I tried to keep my code as dry as possible, but since my data was arranged within 2 separate arrays, this is about as dry as I  could make it. I used classes to create the characters and fabric stores and was able to access the methods within the narration texts. I created a lot of buttons and used click events on each to deliver the user to the next point in the story.

As the user, just click through the decisions that you would like to make.

My biggest problem that I would like to address at a later time would be to dry up my code and to try using a nested array with objects that have the narration texts and options in the same object. that way I can access all the information in one method.
